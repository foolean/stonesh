Stonesh, A.K.A "The Stone Shell", is a shell designed to be run on a
bastion host which facilitates controlled access to internal systems
without providing command-line access on the bastion host itself. 


INSTALLATION
------------

# Debian, Ubuntu
apt-get install build-essential libldap2-dev libgeoip-dev automake autoconf

# CentOS
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install GeoIP-dev openldap-dev automake autoconf

./configure
make
make test
sudo make install


CONFIGURATION
-------------

* edit stonesh.conf

All configurations are kept in stonesh.conf.  See man stonesh.conf
for the list of options.

* edit hosts.lst

Access to internal hosts is permitted via the hosts.lst file.  Requests
for hosts that are not listed in the hosts.lst file are immediately 
denied.  The format of the hosts.lst file is 'host[:port]'.  The port
is optional and provides for connectivity to ssh servers running on 
ports other than the standard tcp/22.  

* edit users.lst (if using local authorization)

Users are authorized via the users.lst file.  Requests from users that are
not listed in the users.lst file are immediately denied.  The users.lst file
is also used to authorize the user's access to specific hosts.  Additionally,
the users.lst file controls whether the user is permitted to use stonesh's
proxy mode feature to the specific host.  The format of the users.lst file
is user:[host1[+],host2[+],...].  The trailing '+' indicates that the user
is permitted to use stonesh's proxy mode to that host.


LDAP AUTHORIZATION
------------------

When enabled, stonesh will authorize client connections against a LDAP
server by looking for appropriate host and authorizedService attributes. 
The user must have a host attribute containing the hostname portion of the
host being requested.  For example; requesting the host 'foo.bar.com' will 
require a host attribute with the value 'foo'.  Connections will be dropped
immediately if the host attribute doesn't exist.

For proxied access, the proper authorizedService attribute must exist.  The
format of the authorizedService value is [tag]-[hostname].  For example; if
the tag is 'proxy' and the requesting proxied access to host 'foo.bar.com' 
will require a authorizedService attribute with the value 'proxy-foo'.


CHROOTING
---------

Whenever possible, it is adventageous to chroot users into an environment
that only contains the applications and libraries necessary to perform
thier work.  stonesh was rewritten from perl to C in order to facilitate
chrooting without having to include perl into the chrooted environment.

Using the ChrootDirectory functionality of sshd(8) is the preferred method
for locking users into a secure environment.   The chrooted environment can
be created, and removed, on the fly using pam_script and the scripts provided
in the contrib directory of the source.


GeoIP
-----

Stonesh utilizes GeoIP to validate a client's country of origin.  The use
of GeoIP is not a perfect sciece but should provide an adequate level of
"positive access control" in ensuring that clients are coming from expected
countries.  It does not prevent an attacker from using a client in a permitted
country to access the bastion.

In order for GeoIP to be as accurate as it can be, it is important that the
GeoIP database files be kept up to date.  You can either obtain an account
with MaxMind or utilize their free databases.  Note: that the free databases
will lag behind reality so your accuracy needs should drive your decision
making.

wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoIPv6.dat.gz

The GeoIP based regression tests use a static database file to ensure that
results are not tainted by changes in the GeoIP data.
